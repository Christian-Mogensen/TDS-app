## About this Project

This project was the first attempt on working with nextjs, tailwindcss, node, firebase and framer-motion.

## What is it?

Its a digitatise version of the book: "The Daily Stoic". A book where you read one page a day, with a filosophical topic.

## What did i do and learn?

- I learned to work with Nextjs.

- I learned how to get comfortable with Tailwindcss.

- I learned to use Framer motion.

- The entire book is converted into a collection of pages. Where each page is a document. That was a daunting task that took 14 hours. But now there is a entire "book" in the shape of a database collection on Firebase. I learned how to structure a database and data, so that it makes sence when working with the data.

- A way to automaticly send a daily email notificator, that automaticly generated a link to the daily page to be read. This was my first time working with node and how to style emails. On top of that, i had to learn how to run a cronjob and made a "clever" hack to vercel using github actions.

- Once the MVP was made: meaning the dynamicly generated pages of the entire book and a landing page. A calendar was up next. I wanted to learn how to manipulate with date api and learned to use date-fns. I ended up building a calendar from the ground up and each day links to the correct page of the year.

## What would i do differently next time?

- Figure out some sort of MVP. Pre design a mockup of the design in figma/Xd. It was very clear to me what i wanted out of this project. But, the process was very much a product of "freestyling" and throw mud on the wall and see what sticks. Structure, would have made this project a lot more managable rather than being a unending stream of features and issues. The amount of frustration I had to endure could have been avoided, if I where more structured.
